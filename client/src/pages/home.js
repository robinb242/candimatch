              <b>Find a Candidate for Minnesota Governor in 2018 whose platform matches your values</b>

                  <p>After two terms in the governorâ€™s office, Democrat Mark Dayton is stepping down, leaving a wide open field that has plenty of candidates clamoring to get in. On the DFL side, that includes a tight race for the endorsement between a U.S. representative, the current state auditor and a legislator from St. Paul. On the Republican side, a crowded field of candidates have emerged, including a former party chairman, a suburban mayor, a county commissioner and plenty of rank-and-file activists. But the entrance of a former governor into the race suggests a possible Republican primary race ahead.</p>
